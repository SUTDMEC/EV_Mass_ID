# EV_Mass_ID
Methods for determining electric vehicle mass in real-time

The MATLAB code here accepts two manditory input variables which need not have common time vectors:

in.tau= power vector [in kW]
in.tautime= power time vector [in s]

NOTE: tau can also be scaled and replaced by electric machine torque

in.vel= speed vector [in km/hr]
in.veltime= speed time vector [in s]
